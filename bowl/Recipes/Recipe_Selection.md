### Significance of Recipes
Rice has a long culturally significant history, and this is demonstrated through cultural recipies around the world. 

In its early days, it would be eaten as brown rice, usually as a side to meats, vegetables, mushrooms, or used in soup dishes.   
But then, polishing came around, turning the brown rice into longer lasting white rice.  

And then cultures from all over the word started to recieve, and make their own rice, eventually adding their own tastes to the seemingly simple dish, creating a wild variety of flavors.
