# THE IMPORTANCE OF RICE
Rice seems like such a small, insignificant food on the surface.  
But, taking the time to look deep into it â€” rice may just be one of, if not the most important food, as it has been imbedded into so many cultures, in so many unique fashions, all completely distinct from one another.

Being originally cultivated in China, only about 9,000+ years ago, the first form of edible rice, "Oryza rufipogon," or wild/red rice, was more eaten as a wheat, rather than how it is traditionally eaten now.
