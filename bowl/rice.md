# THE IMPORTANCE OF RICE
Rice seems like such a small, insignificant food on the surface.  
But, taking the time to look deep into it â€” rice may just be one of, if not the most important food, as it has been imbedded into so many cultures, in so many unique fashions, all completely distinct from one another.

Being originally cultivated as a simple staple crop, meant for feeding mass populations, and religious purposes, it has now transcended that greatly, forming into a food meant for experimentation, cultural expression!
