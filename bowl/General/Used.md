# General History of Rice
Rice has been used in many different ways in the past. It has been used as replacement for sand, it has been used to feed, and it has been used as currency. It is an extremely important food culturally, socially, and physically.

To quote a very important person in my (Kade's) life:
> "Rice is good. Rice is life."
