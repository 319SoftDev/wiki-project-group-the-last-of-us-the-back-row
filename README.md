## What is our topic about?

Rice. Yes, rice.  
Our topic for this markdown site is about the cultural importance and recipes behind rice.

Let me take through how navigating through the website basically works.

# Title of Page <img src="https://cdn.creazilla.com/icons/3196742/emoji-smile-icon-lg.png" alt="Smiley Face Emoji" width="30" height="30">

### Subtitle
This is basically how the layout of pages will usually look like.  
It will usually consist of a very short beginning paragraph, explaining the topic of either the title or subtitle.

Images will be used for visual aid, and credited at the top of said image.

Links will be provided to go to previous, and new sections of the site.
